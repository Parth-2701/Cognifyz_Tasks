# Cognifyz_Tasks 
In the stipulated period of internship with Cognifyz Technologies,  I got to work on an important dataset regarding restaurants all over the world . From just viewing the dataset to actually building regression models and visualising them , these internship tasks had it all and were important for me to understand the concept of data clearly. Below is the brief description of the tasks list.
+ **Level 1 :**
Level 1 was introductory level in which we had to perform basic operations like data exploration and preprocessing,  descriptive and geospatial analysis.
+ **Level 2 :**
Level 2 was intermediate and more challenging than the previous level.In this we performed price range analysis of restaurants and did basic feature engineering .
+ **Level 3 :**
Level 3 was the most important part of this internship. It was in this level that we actually used machine learning algorithms and created our own models.In this level we performed predictive modelling , did customer preference analysis and visualised our findings using various plots.

I hope you will go through the repository and find it useful and like it.
